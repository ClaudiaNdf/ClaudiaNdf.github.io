        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>This is our theoretical model on the effects of heterogeneity on psycho-social outcomes. The model is based on a review of relevant theories from developmental psychology, social psychology, sociology and politics.</p>
		
		<img src="theory-model.png" alt="Theoretical Model" class = "float-image">
		<p>The model describes how classroom heterogeneity on different dimensions is associated with student socio-emotional outcomes.It enumerates 10 pathways by which classroom heterogeneity can impact students' psycho-social outcomes.<br>
		<h3>Heterogeneity</h3>
			<p> The model doesn't specifically focus on any dimension of heterogeneity. Most pathways can in principle apply to different dimensions of heterogeneity. </p>
		<h3>Psycho-social outcomes</h3>
			<p>The focus in our review of theories was on theories that predict psycho-social outcomes. The targeted outcomes include affective, cognitive and behavioral outcomes, including peer relations. Examples for affective outcomes are school belonging, classroom climate, subjective social integration. Cognitive outcomes include different interpersonal skills, but also stereotypes. Behavioral outcomes can be aggression, bullying and victimization, but also pro-social behavior and peer support. Also, relationships in the classroom, like number of friends and inter-group friendships, but also homophily, i.e., ingroup-orientation, are included in the review.</p>
		<h3>Pathways</h3>
			<p>The pathways by which classroom heterogeneity is hypothesised to cause the outcomes, are labeled according to the direction of their influence (P-positive and N-negative). Each pathway is connected to one or more theories from the research fields mentioned above. In the following, each pathway is shortly described.</p>
			<p><b>N1 - Polarization.</b> Socio-cognitive theorists, like Vygotski and Piaget, emphasize that learning takes place in social interaction with others. Here, differences can have a positive impact in that they stimulate children to exchange their views and ideas and develop more advanced concepts (see below P1). However, if students' prior knowledge and experiences are too different, they might not be able to relate to each other anymore, thus leading to less mutual understanding and ultimately, a polarization in outcomes. For these theories, outcomes are typically in the cognitive realm.</p>
			<p><b>N2- Self-enhancement.</b> This pathway is described in Tajfel and Turner's Social Identity Theory. This theory posits that humans try to achieve a positive identity by forming groups along a salient social category and then valuing their in-group and de-valuing the outgroup(s). Which identity is salient in a certain situation can be moderated by contextual clues (M1), like teachers emphasizing a dimension of comparison in the classroom, but also by the composition of the class. Thus, low to medium levels of heterogeneity are often seen as causes for saliency of this dimension.</p>
